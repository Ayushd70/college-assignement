## QUESTIONNAIRES:

#### 1. Why lists are called mutable?
Ans: Unlike strings, lists are mutable. This means we can change an item in a list by accessing it directly as part of the assignment statement. Using the indexing operator (square brackets) on the left side of an assignment, we can update one of the list items.

#### 2. What are the advantages of using list compared to array in C?
Ans: Arrays allow random access and require less memory per element (do not need space for pointers) while lacking efficiency for insertion/deletion operations and memory allocation. On the contrary, linked lists are dynamic and have faster insertion/deletion time complexities.
