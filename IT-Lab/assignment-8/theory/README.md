## QUESTIONNAIRES:


#### 1) What are the advantages of dictionary over list?
```
Ans: Lists are mutable, and hence, they can be altered even after their creation. Dictionary in Python on the other hand is an unordered collection of data values, used to store data values like a map, which unlike other Data Types that hold only single value as an element, Dictionary holds key:value pair.
